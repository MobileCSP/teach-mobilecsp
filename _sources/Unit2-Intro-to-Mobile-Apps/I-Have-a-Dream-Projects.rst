      reinforces the enduring understanding that computing requires a creative development process. First, students modify the existing I Have a Dream app to add new functionality. Then, students develop a soundboard app of their own with sounds and images that express a personal interest of theirs. As part of this process, students must describe the functionality of the user interface and reflect on whether or not their program is working correctly. The breadth of soundboard apps created in the class exemplifies the enduring understanding that programs are developed by people for different purposes.

Learning Activities

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 90 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (10 minutes):</b> Have the students review and explain how the I Have a Dream app was created. Discuss some ideas for enhancements.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (20 minutes):</b> Students work in pairs on enhancements to I Have a Dream; teacher answers questions. Introduce the terms debugging and step wise refinement (see Background Knowledge below). If any of the students finish early, have them begin working on their reflections.</li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (10 minutes):</b> Students make a new entry in their portfolios describing the modifications and enhancements that they made to the I Have a Dream app. Also ask the students to reflect on their programming experience.</li>
    <li><b>Soundboard (50 minutes):</b> Students most likely will not have enough time during one class period to create a soundboard app. Using a second class period, have the students finish them and then share their projects with the class. Students could give brief (2-3 minute) demonstrations of their app to the entire class. Or, try a gallery walk where you split the class in half. One half demos their app at their stations while the other half goes around the room trying the apps. After 15 minutes, have the groups switch so that the ones demoing now get to try out the other students apps.</li>

    <p><b>Assessment Opportunities</b></p>
    <p>You can examine students’ work on the interactive exercise and their reflection portfolio entries to assess their progress on the following learning objectives. If students are able to do what is listed there, they are ready to move on to the next lesson.
        </p><ul>
    <li><i><b>Interactive Exercises:</b></i> Students should be able to identify events, such as shaking or clicking a button as well as use time increments (milliseconds)</li>
    <li><i><b>Portfolio Reflections:</b></i>
    <br/>Students should be able to explain how they were able to collaborate and express themselves creatively in their Soundboard App
              <br/>Students should be able to create a new Soundboard App based on the I Have a Dream app
              <br/>Students should be able to correctly describe the UI components they used in their Soundboard App
          </li>
    <li><i><b>In the Soundboard App, look for:</b></i>
    <br/>-Something unique to each student so that they are expressing themselves creatively
            <br/>-Appropriate naming of components
            <br/>-Use of the if/else statement for pausing and starting the sound associated with the image clicked on
            <br/>-Pausing all other sounds when an image is clicked

    </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="tips">Teaching Tip:  Encouraging Student Persistence and Problem Solving</h3>
    <div class="yui-wk-div">
    <p>It's important to encourage the students to use each other to find solutions 
    to any errors, rather than relying on the teacher for the "correct" answer. 
    This will help them develop good problem solving skills and reinforce 
    their need to be persistent in working towards a solution, even if it fails the 
    first time. <b><i>Step-wise refinement</i></b>, adding and testing one 
    feature at a time, will help them solve their problems easier.</p>
    <p>It's important that students be encouraged to be creative not only in coming 
    up with good ideas for their apps but also in trying to solve the problems that arise 
    during the programming task.  Students should be encouraged to discuss their 
    work and ideas with their partner, with other students, and with the teacher. 
    When a program doesn't work as expected, promote the idea that the student 
    must take on the role of a detective and investigate what is causing the problem. 
    This is what is meant by <b><i>debugging</i></b>. It's also important for 
    students to test their work thoroughly -- it's often not enough to run the app 
    once and conclude that it is correct. Also, incremental additions or <b><i>step wise 
    refinement</i></b> is important when creating correct programs. Have the 
    students try coding one piece of the program and then test the app. Test 
    the app numerous times during development to help discover bugs 
    faster (and sooner).

    <h3 class="bk-knowledge">Background Knowledge:  More on Media Sizes &amp; Editing</h3>
    <div class="yui-wk-div">
    <p>App Inventor apps have a <b>5 Mb size limit</b>.  Therefore not all images and
        sounds that students upload will work in their app.  Here are some tools that can
        be used to resize images and sounds:
    
        </p><ul>
    <li>On MacOS, the <i>Preview</i> application can be used to resize images.  Just
        open the image in Preview and use the <i>Tools</i> menu to resize it.
        </li>
    <li>On Windows machines, the <i>Paint</i> application can be used to resize
        images.  Just open the image and use the <i>Resize</i> tool.
        </li>
    <li>For editing sound files,  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
        Audacity</a> is a free and open source sound file editor for all platforms.
        </li>
    <li>You can also downsize sound files using the free online web app <a href="http://cutmp3.net/" target="_blank">CutMp3.net</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="bk-knowledge">Background Knowledge: Copyright for Images and Sounds</h3>
    <div class="yui-wk-div">
    <p>Many sounds and images online are copyrighted and it is a <b><i>violation
      of copyright</i></b> to include such images in your app.  Students should be made
