Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Ask students what is the Internet? What is the web? Can they explain the difference between the Internet and the WWW — many students will say that they are the same thing.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (35 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Video (10 mins): Present the concepts in the introduction section, which are covered in the
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljCUZHNKoxw" target="_blank">video presentation</a> as well as in the  
         <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AxexCFAWMwo1qckAa2CK-_m-6Y62wBQtOhc4um_uhuU/edit#slide=id.p5" target="_blank">slides</a> and go over the new vocabulary.
      </li>
    <li>POGIL Roles and Teams (5 minutes): Review using <a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/teach_mobilecsp/unit?unit=178&amp;lesson=179" target="_blank">POGIL groupwork with the resources in unit 10.6</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/93407527" target="_blank">the video on POGIL in the classroom</a> from <a href="https://pogil.org/" target="_blank">https://pogil.org</a>.

    <li>Group Discussion (5 minutes): Have a group discussion where each team shares some of their answers.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <p>POGIL, Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning, as used in Mobile CSP, is a structured cooperative learning approach where students work in teams of 3-4 students to solve problems. <a href="https://pogil.org/about/effectiveness" target="_blank">Research suggests</a> that the POGIL approach helps students master the content more effectively and that most students prefer to learn in POGIL teams over more traditional approaches. <a href="https://vimeo.com/93407527" target="_blank">This video</a> provides an overview of POGIL.

    <h3 class="tips">Teaching Tip:  Enforcing POGIL Roles</h3>
    <div class="yui-wk-div">
    <p>One key to POGIL being effective in the classroom is ensuring that students are participating cooperatively - each student is assuming responsibility for their role in the group. As students are working, teachers should be moving around the room and listening to groups to make sure that students are not only staying on task with activities, but are also actively fulfilling their roles. You can print and distribute the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NfNLWJxaG4qZ2Jd2x8UctDS05twn1h6p-o3XaAcRv0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">role cards</a> to each group, or even post them in your classroom for easy reference.</p>
