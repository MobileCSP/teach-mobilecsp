Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (10 minutes):</b>: Watch the videos on models of the solar system's planets. Discuss the differences between them. Some questions to ask might include:
           <br/>What was included in each model? What was left out? What was the purpose of each model?
           <br/><i>Try to make the link between the purpose of the model and the elements that were included in it.</i></li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (30 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Ask students what are predators and prey? Are rabbits and wolves predators or prey?</li>
    <li><span class="yui-non">Demo <a href="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/RabbitsAndWolves/" target="_blank" title="">the rabbits and wolves predator-prey simulation</a> for students just so they know how to find the commands for the activity (running the simulation, viewing the population graph, and changing the initial population amounts). Notes: Make sure you read the tabs for students and instructors on their site. Currently, this simulation works best in the Firefox browser. The  View/Modify parameters button does not currently work in Chrome, but does work in Firefox. If you do not have the Firefox browser installed, you can try different simulations such as this <a href="http://netlogoweb.org/launch#http://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Wolf%20Sheep%20Predation.nlogo" target="_blank" title="">Sheep/Wolves model</a> (click on the blue Setup and then Go). </span></li>
    <li>Divide students into POGIL teams and have them complete the inquiry questions for the activity. These are based on the exploration questions linked in the simulation's instructor tab, but focus more on the idea of testing out a hypothesis.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (5 minutes):</b> Review the answers to the POGIL questions as a class and have students work on their portfolio if time. Students should see that predators are needed to keep prey populations in balance. Students might also notice that rabbits could be considered "predators" of the grass.</li>
