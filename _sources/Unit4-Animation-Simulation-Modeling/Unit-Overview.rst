	<p class="overview">
	This unit focuses on <b>animation</b>, <b>simulation</b> and <b>modeling</b>. The <i>LightsOff app</i> introduces the idea of computer simulation with a computational variation of the traditional Whack-a-Mole game. <i>The Coin Flip app</i>, which extends over several lessons, introduces the concept of modeling. The activities in this unit build toward EU AAP-3 as students learn that models and simulations use abstractions, such as a<b> pseudo random number generator (PRNG)</b>, to represent real world situations, in this case, the flipping of a coin; Students learn how PRNG algorithms are used to model <b>randomness</b> inside a computer, such as with the <i>Coin Flip app</i>; Students extend the app model to represent different types of coins, including a biased coin and a three-sided coin. This is followed by an experiment lesson where an app that repeatedly “flips” a coin is used to assess the quality of App Inventor’s PRNG; Students learn how one’s privacy is impacted by developing technology and computing innovations; and students learn the economic, social and cultural effects of computing innovations, such as real world models of the weather and the solar system.
