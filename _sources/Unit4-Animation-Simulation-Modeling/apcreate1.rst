	<p class="overview">
	 <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit4-Animation-Simulation-Modeling/apcreate1.html" target="_blank" title="">This assessment</a> is a practice CREATE Task that both AP and Non-AP classes can complete. The CREATE task is a required programming performance task. In this programming performance task, students work in pairs to collaboratively develop a mobile app. This includes going through the entire development process of designing, implementing, and debugging a mobile app. Students then document their work by creating a portfolio write-up and share their work through an oral presentation to the class or a recorded video presentation. (Note: the video demonstration is required by the College Board.)

	 <h3>Professional Development</h3> 
	 <p>Depending on the type of professional development you are completing, you will have slightly different requirements:</p>
	 <ul>
	   <li>Online PD - You should read through this lesson and materials, but only need to complete Create #2. Check the pacing guide for specific directions and if you have any questions, reach out to your PD Facilitator.</li>
	   <li>Hybrid PD - You will complete both Create #1 and Create #2, check with your PD Facilitator for specific directions</li>
	   <li>At Your Own Pace - You only need to complete Create #2 to submit with your portfolio for the certificate.</li>

Learning Activities
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 6 hours minimum</h3>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
	 <li><b>Hook/Motivation:</b> So far the students have completed tutorials based on app ideas that already exist. Now, it's the students' time to be creative and develop their very own app. Students will work with a partner to create a <b><i>socially useful</i></b> interactive game and/or tool, that uses graphics, drawing, animation, and/or simulation. Split the students into pairs. You may decide to choose their partner for them or let them pick their own partner.</li>
	 <li><b>Warm-up Activity (45 mins):</b> In pairs or groups, have students complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Y9RPf6IhZ4pZRjtosXdergQPCLRgrmY_TTMr4N9xpU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Design Thinking Process: Design a Chair Warm Up Activity</a>. You will need some craft materials for students to build simple prototype chairs. </li>
	
	 <li><b>Experiences and Explorations:</b>
	   <ul>
	     <li><b>Explanation:</b> Explain the Create #1 task. Students should follow the assignment process for create #1 using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbHDdR-l5JF9xGor-hChrqB8pzCnxgxwMY-vBCZqJYI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Create  Task  with Design Thinking Iterative Process Handout</a>. This is divided into 3+ Iterations. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each iteration will take approximately 2 hours to complete.</span></li>
	     <li><b>Iteration 1 (45-90 mins):</b> Each pair works collaboratively on brainstorming a project idea. 
	       <br>Each pair should develop drawing(s) of the User Interface, as well as, create a rough storyboard of how their app will function. Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ZB7rhEj6-xkbGgnzISvNonuB9Rrjnz13AGkUkTh2CbM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="">wireframe template</a> that can be used. 
	       <br>When brainstorming is completed, each pair should begin preparing for their elevator pitch by completing the following template: 
	       <br><i>[name of app] is a [kind of thing it is] for [the people who would use it] that, unlike [similar apps] is able to [the major distinguishing feature of your app]</i>, and giving an elevator pitch in front of the class. Students should give feedback on the elevator pitch using the questions suggested in the handout.</li>
	     <li><b>Iteration 2 (90-135 mins):</b> Students should work collaboratively to develop, test, and debug a minimum working app. This could be just a User Interface with 1 functioning button. Students should follow the User Interface drawings and storyboard that they designed. Students may work on just one computer together and take turns using the mouse using pair programming or they may work on creating the app in each of their accounts using buddy programming. Students should keep a daily journal or fill out an exit slip describing what they did and problems and solutions they encountered.</li>
	     <li><b>Iteration 3+ (135-180 mins):</b> Students should iteratively add more features following the handout. All work should be saved frequently using the checkpoint button in App Inventor. Encourage students to do more research, such as using the App Inventor glossary to learn more about components and features as they program their app. Students should keep a journal or complete exit slips. AP classes may want to have students work individually at this point. Non-AP classes are encouraged to use pair or buddy programming throughout the project.</li>
	    
	   </ul>
	 </li>
	  <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (45-90 mins):</b> Each student should create a new portfolio page that explains their project. Each pair should have more or less the same content on their individual pages. See How To: Create A Portfolio Write Up. Each pair should give a 5-10 minute oral presentation for the first CREATE PT. (For the second one, if it's submitted to College Board, they will need to create a video. The video is optional for the first one.) Their presentation should include a walkthrough of their portfolio page, as well as include a live demo of their working app. <i>Inviting your school administration, other teachers and students, and parents to the presentations is encouraged.</i></li>

	     <li>This project could be used after Unit 3 or 4 material. If it's included at the end of Unit 4, students could be prompted to create a socially useful game or simulation.</li>
	     <li>It could serve as a midterm project depending on your course schedule.</li>
	     <li>This is a practice project for the final CREATE performance task, however, it does not include an individual component. You could adapt the lesson to have both.</li>
	     <li>You may want to point out and review the Resources page with students. The Resources page provides information on things such as One Minute Lessons that may be helpful to students.</li>
	     <li>If you have time, you may want to plan for a day of "finishing touches" after projects have been completed and presented. Students often get valuable feedback after presenting and taking some time for adding finishing touches to their projects is always rewarding and a good learning opportunity for the students to see what they can do better for the final project.</li>

Professional Development Reflection
-------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

	 <p>Discuss the following questions with other teachers in your professional development program.</p>
	 <ul> 
	   <li>What questions do you have about how to implement the performance task in class? Do you need any clarification on the role of teachers for this performance task? (See College Board's Course and Exam Description, pg. 169-171 for role of teachers in the CREATE task.)</li>
	   <li>Review the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-2021-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" title="">CREATE - Programming Performance Task Scoring Guidelines</a>, paying attention to the content areas (rows) and the descriptors for each performance quality (columns). What areas are you comfortable assessing? What areas do you have questions about?</li>
	   <li>Review the Essential Knowledge statements under each learning objective for the Big Idea of Programming (see the curriculum framework in the CED). Students have now completed a few units of the course, but have more to learn about programming. Which of the essential knowledge statements do you feel are not applicable at this point in the course (i.e. that students should not be evaluated against on this task)?</li>

	Please elaborate on whether there was enough time for the lesson, how you approached the lesson, whether you assigned homework, what was problematic (if anything), and anything else you want to share about this lesson.
