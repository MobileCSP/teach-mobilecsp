    <p class="overview"><a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/unit?unit=23&amp;lesson=53" target="_blank" title="">This lesson</a> creates an App
      Inventor version of the classic Whack-a-Mole game. The student will follow an instructor-led tutorial that will introduce the concepts of <i>animation</i>, <i>timing</i>, and <i>randomness</i>. The student will also see again the concept of a <i>programmer-defined procedure</i>, an important abstraction. This lesson reinforces the enduring understanding that procedures are useful abstractions that are used by programmers to structure and simplify programs.

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> In the prior App Inventor lesson, Paint Pot, we introduced an abstraction concept, a variable. Do the students remember its purpose and why we decided to introduce a variable into the Paint Pot Lesson? Describe the student objectives for today’s lesson. In today's lesson another abstraction concept, the concept of defining a <i>procedure </i>from Paint Pot Refactoring, will be revisited. Remind the students that a procedure is a sequence of instructions that can be carried out by calling the procedure.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (25 minutes):</b> Lead the students through the LightsOff tutorial. Allow faster students to follow the tutorial on their own. Identify new components used in this app, the ImageSprite, and how the ImageSprite component is used to animate the lightBulb. Ensure that students know that ImageSprites require a Canvas component. Lead the design of the UI with the students and walk students through the coding of the app.
    Be sure to spend time reiterating that a procedure is a sequence of instructions that can be carried out by calling the procedure. </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (15 minutes):</b> As a class discuss the following: How was the animation of the ImageSprite achieved in this app? How does a computer program perform animation? How does a computer card game produce a random card number in a specific range of values? Choose students “randomly” to answer the questions. 
         <br/>Have the students try to complete the interactive exercises and complete a reflection in their portfolio. If students do not finish the reflection in class, have them finish it for homework.</li>
