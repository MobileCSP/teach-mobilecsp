Projects
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<p>While the course is set up so that students can submit and review each others projects online, that is entirely up to individual teachers. Each class will be working at their own pace and so may have projects ready at different times of the year. However, students might find it a unique way to interact with others and see what kinds of projects have been created for this course.</p>
