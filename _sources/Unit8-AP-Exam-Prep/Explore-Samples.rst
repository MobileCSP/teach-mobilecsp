		<p>Virtual reality has the potential to change many things about the way we interact with computers and our environment. Virtual reality exists in two forms: virtual reality creates a new, virtual world around you, while augmented reality enhances your surroundings to provide information (Charara). Augmented reality has significant potential to change the way we interact in the future, by providing us with beneficial information such as time, messages, directions, and other relevant or timely information with ease. By wearing a pair of glasses, one could read messages without holding his/her phone, reducing distractions. Since it is easier to focus on your surroundings when not looking at a phone, augmented reality has the potential to cut down on distracted walking- or cycling-related accidents. However, a harmful effect virtual reality may have on society is that people may become absorbed in the virtual world, and only interact through it instead of through face-to-face communication. Some may see it as an alternative to visiting others, which could increase the problem of obesity, while also increasing isolation and mental health problems (LaMotte).</p>

A data privacy concern associated with virtual reality is the potential ability for companies to access the video or other sensor data recorded by these headsets, which could be used for things without your consent.
