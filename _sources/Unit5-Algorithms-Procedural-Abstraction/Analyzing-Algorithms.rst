Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 90 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Have students hypothesize about which sort and search algorithms are the fastest. Have them explain their reasoning. (They should identify radix/bucket sort and binary search of the ones covered.) <b>Explanation:</b> we reason about algorithms (formally/mathematically - analytically and experimenting - empirically) to determine their efficiences</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (75 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Lecture - Analyzing Search:</b> Give the presentation about analyzing search algorithms (or show the video).</li>
    <li><b>Activity - Search Experiment:</b> Have students complete the search experiment, recording results and then plotting them on graph paper or the given spreadsheet. Emphasize that this is a worst-case analysis.</li>
    <li><b>Lecture - Analyzing Sort:</b> Give the presentation about analyzing sort algorithms (or show the video).</li>
    <li><b>Activity - Sort Experiment:</b> Have students complete the sort experiment, recording results and then plotting them on graph paper or the given spreadsheet. Emphasize that this is a worst-case analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (10 minutes):</b> Have students share the results of their experiments and complete their portfolio reflections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The College Board's <a href="http://myap.collegeboard.org" target="_blank" title="AP Classroom Site">AP Classroom</a> provides a question bank and Topic Questions. You may create a formative assessment quiz in AP Classroom, assign the quiz (a set of questions), and then review the results in class to identify and address any student misunderstandings.The following are suggested topic questions that you could assign once students have completed this lesson.</p>
    <p><b>Suggested Topic Questions:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Topic 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can examine studentsâ€™ work on the interactive exercise and their reflection portfolio entries to assess their progress on the following learning objectives. If students are able to do what is listed there, they are ready to move on to the next lesson.</p>

    <h3>Answers to Student Reflection Questions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>This algorithm is linear.  In the worst case you need to check each number 1 to N to see if it is divisible by M. </li>
    <li>Quick sort is an <i>n log n</i> algorithm.  So most similar to merge sort. Which case is closer to worst?  The <i>few unique keys</i> is the worst case.  You 
            can see this by observation. </li>

Professional Development Reflection
------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <p>Discuss the following questions with other teachers in your professional development program.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How does this lesson encourage students to think analytically and empirically about algorithms?</li> <!-- for an EU -->
    </ul>
    <!-- These are the PD exit slips.  We should have corresponding exit slips for use after the classroom lesson. -->
