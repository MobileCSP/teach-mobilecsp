Wrap Up

        <div class="gcb-lesson-content" data-question-batch-id="L148" data-scored="False">
    <p>This lesson is meant to be a stopping point to check students' understanding of the material covered thus far, before proceeding to the next unit.
    </p>
    <p>Each unit wrap up will provide App Inventor drills that would be appropriate for the material covered in the unit. 
    As an instructor, you also have the option to give a unit quiz to your students.

    <p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5ZVxaK8f0u9azJYV2xDRldEYTQ">Google Drive repository of App Inventor drills</a> currently contains <i>six</i> sets of drill like exercises for students to complete. These drills can be used as much, or as little, as you would like. In some cases, recommendations on which set of drills to use are provided at the end of the unit. </p>

    <h3>Mobile CSP Assessments</h3>
     <p><i>Note - Assessments are only available to verified educators who have joined the <a href="../Unit1-Getting-Started/PD-Joining-the-Forum.html" target="_blank">Teaching Mobile CSP Google group/forum in Unit 1</a>.</i> 
        <br> Mobile CSP has created an assessment bank of questions that can be used for each unit and at the end of the course. This assessment bank is designed to be made ONLY available to teachers and not to students, except when administering the assessment. A tool to create your own assessments from a spreadsheet is available, but requires an understanding of scripts in Google Sheets. Alternatively, you can access a Google Doc and Form version of the assessments using these links: </p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y9NFbQc7W_c7hH8UgOmuvjPmYEir2mJkZAHGs1nZdyQ" target="_blank">Directions</a> - Please review carefully</li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vHYpmHvXBvDmwbaAUEiNzoKwFoI9E_l67Jif8e_iENI/" target="_blank" title="">Google Doc</a> - please make a COPY to edit</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Many of the Mobile CSP teachers from previous years have decided to quiz students in between the larger exams (midterm and final). Some of those teachers have shared their quizzes. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5ZVxaK8f0u9ZDlMa3RpS0NhZ1k&amp;usp=sharing">Mobile CSP Assessments Repository</a> contains copies of those quizzes (most of which were made with Google Forms) and instructions for how to use those quizzes. </p>
    <p>You are also welcome to create your own quizzes. If you have a quiz you'd like to submit to the repository, please email us at research@mobile-csp.org</p>
