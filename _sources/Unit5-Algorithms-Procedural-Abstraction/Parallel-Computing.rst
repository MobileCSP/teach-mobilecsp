Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes): </b>Take this time to review the <i>searching</i> and <i>sorting</i> algorithms (from earlier in this unit) with students as well as review how algorithms are analyzed by their <i>efficiency</i>. </li><li><b>Experiences and Explorations (35 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Part 1 - Parallel Computing: </span>Introduce the concepts of <i><b>sequential</b></i>, <b><i>parallel,</i></b> and <i><b>distributed </b></i>computing. Explain how the <i style="font-weight: bold;">speedup</i> of a parallel solution is determined.</li><li style=""><span style="font-weight: 700;">POGIL Activity #1 - Searching: </span>Divide the class into groups of four. Give each group a deck of playing cards and have them complete the tasks.</li><li style=""><span style="font-weight: 700;">Part 2 - Benefits and Challenges of Parallel Computing: </span>Share and discuss some of the benefits and challenges of using parallel computing.</li><li style=""><span style="font-weight: 700;">POGIL Activity #2 - Sorting: </span>Divide the class into groups of four. Give each group a deck of playing cards and have them complete the tasks. By doing this activity students should gain an understanding that the speed is controlled by dividing and merging the deck.</li><li style=""><span style="font-weight: 700;">Part 3 - Distributed Computing: </span>Use the diagram to explain the differences between parallel and distributed computing. Then watch the distributed computing video (if you are running low on time, you may choose to show parts of the video).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (5 minutes)</b>: Have students complete the interactive exercises and portfolio reflections.</li>
