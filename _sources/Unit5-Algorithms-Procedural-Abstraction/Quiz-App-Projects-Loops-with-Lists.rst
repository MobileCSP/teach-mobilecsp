    <p class="overview"><a href="../mobilecsp/unit?unit=24&amp;lesson=82" target="_blank" title="">This lesson</a> reinforces the use of if/else statements and lists to keep accurate score in the Quiz app and introduces loops with lists by adding a search function which also uses a procedure with a parameter. Students are also given an opportunity to express their creativity by creating their own version of a quiz app on a different topic, and by adding an enhancement of their choosing to the app. The AP CSP pseudocode for lists is also reviewed.</p>

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 90 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (10 minutes):</b> The previous lesson focused on using a ListPicker component and creating lists to manage data. Recall with an elbow partner how you designed your app to manage the question and answer data in the Quiz tutorial. What component did you use and how did you represent the questions and answers in this lab? What are some possible enhancements you could do?</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (25 minutes):</b> Show the intro and loops with lists videos or present the information using the slides. Direct students to the  Quiz App Mini Projects. Students work in pairs to complete the mini projects on their own. 
        <ul>
    <li>For mini project #1, keeping score accurately, you could demonstrate how the app can be "hacked" to earn higher scores if you only add a score variable without keeping track of whether a question has already been answered. (Hint: Answer any question correctly then click the Answer button repeatedly.)</li>
    <li>For mini project #2, talk about how a loop can be used to iterate through a list.</li>
    <li>As they work on their own quiz and enchancement (mini project #3), students should share and test their quizzes with each other to get feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (10 minutes):</b> Students make a new entry in their portfolios where they describe the modifications and enhancements that they made to the Quiz app. Also, ask the students to reflect on their programming experience. Discuss the the solutions to the mini projects as a class, especially the use of a list and the algorithm for keeping score and the loop for a search. Students should check their understanding by completing the interactive exercises. Any unfinished work should be completed as homework. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The College Board's <a href="http://myap.collegeboard.org" target="_blank" title="AP Classroom Site">AP Classroom</a> provides a question bank and Topic Questions. You may create a formative assessment quiz in AP Classroom, assign the quiz (a set of questions), and then review the results in class to identify and address any student misunderstandings.The following are suggested topic questions that you could assign once students have completed this lesson.</p>

    <p>You can examine students’ work on the interactive exercise and their reflection portfolio entries to assess their progress on the following learning objectives. If students are able to do what is listed there, they are ready to move on to the next lesson.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><i><b>Interactive Exercises:</b></i> </li>
    <li><i><b>Portfolio Reflections:</b></i>
    <br/>LO X.X.X - Students should be able to ...
          </li>
    <li><i><b>In the Quiz App Projects app, look for:</b> use of a loop with lists</i>
    <br/>#1 Keeping Accurate Score - students should create a list the same size as the number of questions with each value set to false. When a correct answer is given, the corresponding spot in the list is then changed to true. The scoring algorithm should be updated so that it only increments the score if the initial value was false. 
            <br/>#2 Search - search of NASA brings up the right question. A loop is used.
            <br/>#3 New Quiz - students should create a new quiz but with different questions, images, and answers. Algorithms should remain the same, but the media and question and answer lists content will be different.
