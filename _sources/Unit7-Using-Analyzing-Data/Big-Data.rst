    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Ask students to guess how many tweets are made per day, hour, minute, second. Show the <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics" target="_blank">Twitter Usage Statistics</a> page after they've guessed. Explain that this is an example of big data and the page includes various visualizations of that data.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (30 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Video Presentation (5 minutes):</b> Show one or two of the following videos on big data.  Have students work in pairs to come up with a definition for big data.
            <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqfeUUjAIyQ" target="_blank">The Economist Video</a> (2:20) - Narrated slide show, emphasizes <b><i>exponential growth</i></b>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrNlZ7-SMPk" target="_blank">Link Analytics</a> (3:05) - Fast moving overview with lots of quantitative facts, electronic soundtrack, commercial ending. </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen" target="_blank">TedTalk: The best stats you've ever seen</a> (19:53) - The first few minutes emphasize the need to communicate effectively with data. Uses the gapminder data set.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D1CQ_LOizA" target="_blank">Explaining Big Data</a> (8:32) - Narrated, animated slide show, includes coverage of <b><i>Hadoop</i></b> starting at 4:13.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Slide Presentation (25 minutes):</b> Present the material in the slide deck (or show the associated videos). Discuss how their definitions (and understanding) 
    may have changed. Have students complete the self-check exercises after each video (as a class or in pairs).</li>
    <li><b>Activity (10 minutes):</b> Have the students explore the data sets and answer their portfolio reflection questions about that data set. (More data sets are 
    linked below under Additional Resources)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (5 minutes):</b> Ask students to share their portfolio reflections. Focus the discussion around the amount of data, the structure of the data, how the data is visualized, and any security or privacy concerns about the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Additional Resources</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Students can install the <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">SETI@Home screensaver</a> on their laptops to help search for extraterrestrial civilizations by letting their computer be used to search through radio astronomy data when it's not being  used.  Another example of citizen science would be the <a href="https://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding@Home</a> screensaver, which helps scientists search large datasets for cures for Alzheimers and other diseases.</li>
