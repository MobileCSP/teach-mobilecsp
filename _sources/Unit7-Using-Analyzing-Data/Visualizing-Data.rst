Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Using the animated gif image from census.gov or another data visualization of your own choice,  put the graphic of the data on the projector and ask the students these questions about it:
         <ul>
    <li>What is the data shown in this visualization?</li>
    <li>What type of data is used — text, numbers, geocodes, date and time, etc.?</li>
    <li>What conclusions can you draw from the data?</li>
    <li>How is the data presented in the visualization that makes it easy to understand and use?</li>
    <li>What are the drawbacks of this visualization?</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Explanation:</b> There is an information explosion going on (recall Blown to Bits Chapter 1) and large sets of information are becoming more accessible to the public (recall Big Data). Computers provide powerful tools to process all of this information. It's important in the 21st century to be conversant with these tools and to be able to use them to gain knowledge and insight.  Google spreadsheets and Google Maps can help to manipulate and visualize large data sets. The way in which data is manipulated can influence interpretation. For example, a graph of test scores can help individuals make conclusions quicker and more easily than a table with test scores. This is because a graph allows individuals to visually notice trends in the data.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (30 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Activity Intro:</b> Explain the instructions for today's class. Students will follow the student tutorials to answer the questions working in pairs.</li>
    <li><b>Activity 1: </b>May be done as a class or in pairs</li>
    <li><b>Activity 2:</b> Have the students follow to create formulas and charts with the given data set on butterflies using Google Sheets.</li>
    <li><b>Activity 3:</b> Have students create a map of the data using Google My Maps following the tutorial. Here's a possible <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bchyNEIlsZEhwc2M7EilK61C6UY&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank">solution</a></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (10 minutes):</b> Have students complete their reflection in their portfolios. </li>

    <p>The College Board's <a href="http://myap.collegeboard.org" target="_blank" title="AP Classroom Site">AP Classroom</a> provides a question bank and Topic Questions. You may create a formative assessment quiz in AP Classroom, assign the quiz (a set of questions), and then review the results in class to identify and address any student misunderstandings. The following are suggested topic questions that you could assign once students have completed this lesson.</p>
