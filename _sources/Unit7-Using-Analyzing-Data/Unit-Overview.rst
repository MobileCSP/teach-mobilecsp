	<p class="overview">This unit focuses on various aspects of using and manipulating Data, both within mobile apps and on the Web and Internet. The App Inventor lessons in this unit focus on different types of programming data, including variables and structured data, such as lists and databases.&nbsp; Students will build apps that involve persistent data, data that persists from one instance of the app to another, and learn how to share data online by using databases, such as Google Firebase. This unitâ€™s CS Principles lessons build toward EU DAT-2 and EU IOC-1 by focusing on the concept of Big Data and its growing importance. Students will also be introduced to some of the algorithms needed to process massive datasets efficiently.
