    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 90 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Explain to students that they'll be using what they learned in the previous lesson to explore a data set of their choosing with a partner. Lead a short brainstorming session on what data might be available publicly, encouraging them to think about who collects data (government, science, etc.)</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (55 minutes):</b>
    <ol>
    <li>(5 minutes) Remind students of the process to generate hypotheses - first form a question about their data set and then put it in to the "If ___, then ___" form.</li>
    <li>(10 minutes) Give students some time to explore the data sets linked in the lesson plan and to start developing questions and hypotheses.</li>
    <li>(5 minutes) Review how to download and import different kinds of data sources such as CSV files.</li>
    <li>(35 minutes) Students should work in pairs to develop visualizations for their hypotheses and then write their portfolio reflections. Class presentations may also be made.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (10 minutes):</b> In a whip around format, ask students to give an example of how working with a partner helped them gain new insights into their data projects.</li>
