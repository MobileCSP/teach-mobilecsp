Wrap Up
=======

        <div class="gcb-lesson-content" data-question-batch-id="L149" data-scored="False">
    <p>This lesson is meant to be a stopping point to check students' understanding of the material covered thus far, before proceeding to the next unit.
    </p>
    <p>Each unit wrap up will provide App Inventor drills that would be appropriate for the material covered in the unit. 
    As an instructor, you also have the option to give a unit quiz to your students.

App Inventor Drills
--------------------

    <p>
    <p>For this unit, there is one set of coding drills linked to the Wrap-up Unit on the student-facing site.  These can be assigned as additional exercises to help improve coding knowledge and skills.  Solutions are linked only to the teacher-facing site.

    <h3>Mobile CSP Assessments</h3>
    <p>Mobile CSP has created an assessment bank of questions that can be used for each unit and at the end of the course. This assessment bank is designed to be made ONLY available to teachers and not to students, except when administering the assessment. A tool to create your own assessments from a spreadsheet is in the works, but still has some issues. For now, you can access a Google Doc and Form version of the assessments using these links. </p>

Other Assessment Materials:

    <p>
    <p>Many of the Mobile CSP teachers from previous years have decided to quiz students in between the larger exams (midterm and final). Some of those teachers have shared their quizzes. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5ZVxaK8f0u9ZDlMa3RpS0NhZ1k&amp;usp=sharing">Mobile CSP Assessments Repository</a> contains copies of those quizzes (most of which were made with Google Forms) and instructions for how to use those quizzes. <b>Note: Assessments are only available to verified educators that have joined the Teaching Mobile CSP Google group/forum in Unit 1. Please <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/teach-mobilecsp/Unit1-Getting-Started/PD-Joining-the-Forum.html" target="_blank" title="">go here to sign up for the Teaching Mobile CSP forum</a>.</b> Membership in this forum gives teachers access to the following resources:
