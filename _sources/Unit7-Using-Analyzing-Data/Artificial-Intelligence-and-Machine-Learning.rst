With machine learning a computer learns how to perform a task or solve a problem not by being given a traditional program to solve the problem, but by being given lots of data examples of correct and incorrect solutions to the problem. </p>

    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 70-90 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Have students try <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Google Quick Draw</a> which uses machine learning to recognize doodles. Ask students how do you think it learns to recognize them? After 5 guesses, quick draw will show you the summary where you can click on each doodle and it will show you the closest matches. </li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (60-80 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Video Presentation (10 minutes):</b> Show the  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QghjaS0WQQU&ab_channel=GCFLearnFree.org" target="_blank">video</a> (2 minutes) on Machine Learning embedded in the course page and discuss.
           
       </li>
    <li><b>Teachable Machine Activity (20 minutes):</b> Have the students explore the <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Teachable Machine</a> activity embedded in the course. Have them work in pairs to do the suggested experiments. 
    </li>
    <li> <b>Video Presentation (20 minutes):</b> Show the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV0_raKR2UQ&ab_channel=CrashCourse" 
    target="_blank">video (12 mins)</a> about algorithmic bias and discuss.
    </li>
    <li><b>Algorithmic Bias POGIL Activity (20 minutes):</b> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1EeKdVzbUGiBGNa8GE3zamEd9-rBIpDyvQMJB4rXsM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Worksheet to complete this POGIL Activity</a>. </li>

    <p>The College Board's <a href="http://myap.collegeboard.org" target="_blank" title="AP Classroom Site">AP Classroom</a> provides a question bank and Topic Questions. You may create a formative assessment quiz in AP Classroom, assign the quiz (a set of questions), and then review the results in class to identify and address any student misunderstandings.The following are suggested topic questions that you could assign once students have completed this lesson.</p>
    <p><b>Suggested Topic Questions:</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Topic 5.3 Computing Bias</li>
