Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Variables are simple data abstractions. What if we could save more than one item under one variable? For example a list of destinations. How would you know which destination to pull out of memory? (students should be led to numbering items on the list). <br/> For APIs, go to <a href="http://wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and search for something. How did the URL change? Can you switch to a different page by just changing the URL? How might Can the app use these URLs?  </li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (30 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Walk-through (15 minutes):</b>  Lead the students through the Map Tour Tutorial using the video or the text tutorial or the short handout.</li>
    <li><b>Lists</b> Go through the lesson write up about lists introducing the new vocabulary, the new blocks, and the corresponding AP pseudocode.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (10 minutes):</b> Ask the students do some or all of the enhancements. Students should write a reflection in their portfolio (this may be assigned for homework) and try the interactive exercises. There are also other possible enrichment activities, including a tutorial called Map A Run, in the Enrichment section below. </li>

    <p>The College Board's <a href="http://myap.collegeboard.org" target="_blank" title="AP Classroom Site">AP Classroom</a> provides a question bank and Topic Questions. You may create a formative assessment quiz in AP Classroom, assign the quiz (a set of questions), and then review the results in class to identify and address any student misunderstandings. The following are suggested topic questions that you could assign once students have completed this lesson.</p>
    <p><b>Suggested Topic Questions:</b></p><br/><ul><li><span style="font-weight: normal;">Topic 3.2 Data Abstraction</span><br/></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topic 3.4 Strings</span><br/></li></ul></h4>

    <p>Students can explore GPS and location features by trying to create a map tour for local landmarks or landmarks in a different location than given in the tutorial.</p>
    <p>Here is a fun tutorial called the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5IJIFb9H85IjuLPQDYhExFQf2M3JqFyrb9qPrCvkck/">Map A Run App</a> which keeps track of where you have gone on a map. Student will probably need to use this app outside with GPS and WiFi or a cellular connection.</p>
