    <p class="overview"><a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit3-Creating-Graphics-Images/Parity-Error-Checking-optional.html" target="_blank" title="">This lesson</a> is a follow up to the error detection card trick lesson.  It introduces the technical concept of <i>parity error checking</i> where redundant bits added to a data representation can be used to detect certain types of errors. It reinforces the enduring understanding that binary sequences are used to represent and transmit all digital data. </p>

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Share the cartoon and joke in the <a href="http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-04-error_detection.pdf" target="_blank">CS Unplugged activity on pg. 36</a>:<br/>
           Q: What do you call a parrot saying "pieces of nine, pieces of nine"?<br/>
           A: A parroty error (the parrot should be saying "pieces of eight")
    <br/>
    (This is an old joke.  It may be necessary to explain that "pieces of eight" are gold pieces.)
    </li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (25 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Explanation (5 minutes):</b> Review the error detection card trick.Remind students that errors in data transmission and storage can occur. When errors do occur, they are detected by using parity bits.</li>
    <li><b>Lecture (10 minutes):</b>  Use the narrative on the student version of the course. Focus on the types of parity schemes (even and odd). Students should be able to understand what a parity bit is and understand each of the parity schemes that can be used in error detection.</li>
    <li><b>Hands on (10 minutes):</b> Have the students work in pairs to have more practice with even and odd parity schemes. Teacher answers any questions the students might have. Use the interactive exercises in the Mobile CSP lesson.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (5 minutes):</b> Ask the students to write a reflection in their Google portfolio that explains what they learned about even and odd parity schemes. In their reflection, students should explain how the error detection card trick involves a parity scheme. </li>
    </ul>
