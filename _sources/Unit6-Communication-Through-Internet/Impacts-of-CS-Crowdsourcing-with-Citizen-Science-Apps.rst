Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 90 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation: (5 minutes):</b> Ask students if anyone can explain how projects are funded through Kickstarter or other crowdfunding apps. Explain that crowdfunding is a type of crowdsourcing where many people contribute to fund a project. In computing, crowdsourcing relies on the many people collaborating to help solve a problem, contribute resources (such as computer processing time), or disseminate results. Citizen science apps are one example of using the power of crowdsourcing to solve science problems using mobile apps.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Exploration (15-60 minutes):</b>  Watch Episode 1 of The Crowd and the Cloud. If you do not have time to watch the entire hour-long episode, then focus on the OpenStreetMap [16:55-28:30] and EyesOnALZ [28:30-41:57] segments.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Exploration (30 minutes):</b>  Students can work individually or in pairs to select an app from the <a href="http://crowdandcloud.org/join-a-project" target="_blank">Join a Project</a> page and answer the questions on purpose, data, and effects. Students should discuss the answers to their questions with another student or pair of students.</li>
    <li><b>Reflect and Revise (5 minutes):</b> Ask students to record their answers in their portfolios.</li>
    </ul>
