Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Ask students how they receive Internet service at
         at home,  cable? satellite?  name of their ISP (Internet Service Provider). Ask them how fast their Internet is and introduce the term <em>bandwidth</em>. Explain that this lesson introduces some  
         basic Internet terminology and they'll learn about latency and bandwidth, which are terms that are used in the AP CSP exam.
      </li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (35 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Lecture, Part 1: Basic Concepts and Terminology (5.5 mins)</b>. Present the first lecture, video (5:29) or slides (28), on concepts and terminology.  </li>
    <li><b>Activity 1 - Collaboration on the Internet (5 mins):</b> Show students how to access and explore The Internet Society's <a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/map/global-internet-report/#global-internet-penetration" target="_blank">interactive portal</a> to their annual report.  There are lots of data sets that can be explored.  The activity has suggested questions to discuss in class including a discussion of the <i>digital divide</i>. </li>
    <li><b>Lecture, Part 2: Client/Server Model (3.5 mins)</b>. Present the second lecture, video (3:37) or slides (15).</li>
    <li><b>Activity 2 - Client/Server Model (7 mins):</b>  The activity asks them to identify various parts of the client/server model accessing some demo web pages using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_98lN-rMLDScg9EPTUdFfdY36cGFd2njqkFF2NLtPSI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this handout</a> which students could use online or in a printout.<br/>  Answers:  The client is the student's computer or browser app.  The server is https://course.mobilecsp.org. The protocol is http or https (secure). The client requests the web page webpage2.html.  And the server responds by sending that web page.  </li>
    <li><b>Lecture, Part 3: Internet Performance (6.5 mins).</b> Present the third lecture, video (6:26) or slides (17).</li>
    <li><b>Activity 3 - Measuring Bandwidth (7 mins): </b> Have students run the tests as described on the student branch. Have them share their data with others in the class.     <i>Optional - have them collect data at home or at a public place such as a coffee shop or the library and share it the next day in class.</i></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (5 minutes):</b> In whatever time remains, have students  complete the self-check questions and their portfolio reflections.</li>
