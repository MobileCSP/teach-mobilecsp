    <ul>
    <li>Access to computer, laptop, or Chromebook (install the Companion app on Chromebooks)</li>
    <li>Access to mobile devices with the Companion app installed or access to the emulator installed on the computer or laptop. (suggested <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CqfqPdG9DQJK1Ibw9RxykoOScQlEA4zJaVbPUICp8NY/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">list of mobile devices</a>)</li>
    <li>Teachers should verify ahead of time that there are no significant barriers to connecting your mobile devices and App Inventor at  your school. There may be firewall issues, so please test ahead of time!

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 25-45 minutes</h3>
    <ol>
    <li><b>Video (5 mins):</b> Show the intro to App Inventor video from MIT in class. When this video was made, CS was not usually taught in high school! But luckily, things have changed.</li>
    <li><b>Activity (15-30 minutes):</b> Following the directions in  <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit1-Getting-Started/App-Inventor-Setup.html" target="_blank" title="">Unit 1 Lesson 1.4: App Inventor Set Up</a>, students should click on the App Inventor template, login to App Inventor with their Gmail accounts and then run the test app on a mobile device or emulator. They can follow the embedded tutorial to the left of the App Inventor screens. This lesson may last longer if there are connection issues at your school. Follow the troubleshooting links above. If you have students whose first language is not English, you may want to have them pull down the language menu where it says English at the top right of App Inventor to switch to their own language. </li>
    <li><b>Reflection (5 mins): </b> Ask students what they liked about App Inventor so far.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Google Accounts</h3>
    <p>Your school email may already be based on Gmail accounts. It may work with all the Google products used during the course, but it may not as well. For example, you may be able to access Google Sites, but not App Inventor. Test it out during the summer to determine which route is best for your school. You may need to have each student create a brand new Gmail just for this course.<br/></p>
