	<p class="overview"> This unit is meant to be reviewed by instructors prior to the start of classroom teaching with students. Some of the lessons include activities with accompanying lesson plans that should be completed the first week of class with students.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Teacher Branch vs. Student Branch</h3>
	
	<p>Content in this branch is specific to instructors, including lesson plans and pedagogy. 
	In the companion, <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/index.html" target="_blank" title="">student 
	branch</a>, the actual Mobile CSP content is presented. You can have your students 
	register for the other course themselves and use it during the school year.</p>
	<p>Some teachers find it easier to review the Teach Mobile CSP lesson first, and then complete
	the student activities. Some find it more helpful to complete the student activities and then
	review the accompanying lesson plan here on the Teach branch. It is entirely up to you which
	order you review them, as long as you are looking at both the student and teacher branches.</p>
