    <p class="overview"><a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit1-Getting-Started/Impacts-of-CS-Blown-to-Bits-BB.html" target="_blank" title="">This lesson</a> introduces the book that will be used for many of the global impact readings. In this unit, students are simply introduced to the textbook. In Unit 2, they will begin by reading Chapter 1.</p>
   
    <p>Teachers who have used the <i>Blown to Bits</i> text in their classroom usually provide the students a link to the readings rather than printing off the text. However, if the student needs to complete some of the readings at home, then you may want to provide printed copies to those without Internet access. A computer lab may be required for some lesson activities, but some of them could be done outside a lab if you have printed copies of the readings. Each lesson extends over 3-4 hours and also includes questions that students will answer on their portfolio site. Readings from the textbook are supplemented with current news and events in each lesson. You are encouraged to ask students to find and bring in news as well.<br/></p>

Pedagogy: Reading in the Content Area
--------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <p>Below are several videos developed by Dr. Neil Witikko, Associate Professor of education at the College of St. Scholastica. Dr. Witikko teaches a graduate education course on reading in the content area. All the <span style="font-style: italic;">Blown to Bits</span> lessons have been reviewed by him to incorporate strategies to support students as they tackle these post-secondary level readings. He has also developed a set of videos that outline strategies for helping students read in the content area, especially for texts like this that are at a college-level.

Alignment with Common Core
---------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <p>The work in the <i>Blown to Bits</i> lessons aligns effectively with the following Common Core Reading Standards for Informational Texts (Grades 11-12):</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text, including determining where the text leaves matters uncertain.</li>
    <li>Determine two or more central ideas of a text and analyze their development over the course of the text, including how they interact and build on one another to provide a complex analysis; provide an objective summary of the text.</li>
    <li>Analyze a complex set of ideas or sequence of events and explain how specific individuals, ideas, or events interact and develop over the course of the text.</li>
    <li>Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative, connotative, and technical meanings; analyze how an author uses and refines the meaning of a key term or terms over the course of a text (e.g., how Madison defines faction in Federalist No. 10).</li>
    </ol>
