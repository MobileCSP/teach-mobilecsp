AP<sup>®</sup> Equity and Access Policy
----------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <p>The College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding principle for their AP® programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial,and socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their student population. The College Board also believes that all students should have access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved. For more information please visit the <a href="https://professionals.collegeboard.org/k-12/assessment/ap/equity" target="_blank" title="">College Board's website</a>.

    <p>It's also not enough to just add CS Principles to your school's course offerings. You'll need to help students understand why they should take the course and why working with App Inventor is going to change their lives. It's very important to also keep in mind that the computer science community benefits from having everyone represented in the CS classroom - including girls and minorities. Here are some resources you can use in your recruitment efforts.</p>
