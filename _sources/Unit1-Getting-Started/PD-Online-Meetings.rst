    <p>Those participating in the professional development will be expected to participate in at least one synchronous Zoom meeting each week with your professional learning community (PLC) and mentor teacher.<br/><br/>If you haven't used Zoom before, we suggest the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Try to do your meeting in a quiet place, using a good microphone/headset.</li>
    <li>Test a meeting with a friend or family member before doing one in your group.</li>
    <li><span style="line-height: 1.22;">Use Google Docs to take notes in your meeting.</span><br/></li></ul>
