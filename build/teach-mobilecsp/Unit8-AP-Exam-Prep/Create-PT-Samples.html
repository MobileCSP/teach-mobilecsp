<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>The video and narration are well planned out and executed.  It is simple and yet thoroughly explains the app.
     The two things to remember the difference between are purpose and function.  Purpose is the intended goal or
     objective of the program.  Function is how the program works.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
        <p>2b. Being unfamiliar with Firebase’s structure, I encountered a problem while programming when I tried to include a 3rd Firebase database.
         Upon the addition of the component and the corresponding coding elements, my app could no longer be packaged or loaded onto a device for
         testing. My app would always crash while loading. Unable to find a clear syntax error, I resolved the issue by debugging and deleting
         portions of the code until the app would finally successfully load and then reprogramming the deleted portions of code. Another difficulty
         I encountered was transferring variables across screens in order to access the correct user’s data. Opening a new screen in App Inventor
         would clear the values of the variable on the device, which would render them unusable on the next screen. I resolved this independently
         by assembling the contents of each screen into its own arrangement, and utilizing the .visible property of these arrangements to make
         them appear and disappear, providing the illusion of multiple screens and allowing the accessed variable values to be consistent across
         all “screens”.</p>

<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>Students should explicitly label their opportunities or difficulties as done in this example.  Adding the sentence structures “the first…”

     spot-on by specifically using the phrase “I resolved”.</p>

        </td>

</tbody></table>
<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>Students should take the time to explicitly describe the logical or mathematical concepts used in the design of the algorithm. This statement,
     “redirect the program to either proceed with a login or create account procedure.” talks about the selection process, but could put more emphasis
     on it being the logical part of the algorithm.
Great use of the phrase “the algorithm examines” points out the function of it.  To show the relation to overall program, this example uses another
     great sentence structure  “...is an important algorithm as it handles...”</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
        <p>2c. As my program uses Firebase databases to store user data, AccountDB.GotValue is an important algorithm as it handles all data retrieved
         from the account database such as users and passwords. Because Firebase data requests are handled asynchronously to the program, it is
         necessary that when data is sent back from Firebase, the algorithm examines the tag and values sent back in order to properly redirect the
         program to either proceed with a login or create account procedure.&nbsp; One of the integrated algorithms is the procedure called
         loginProcedure (above). When called, the procedure loginProcedure will login in the user and load up the user’s diary entries if the correct
         password is entered. Otherwise, an error message will appear and the user will have to try again.
        The procedure createAccount shown above is another integrated algorithm that helps create a user’s account and mark the designated locations for
         the user’s data in Firebase given that they had provided a valid password and an unique username. The integration of the two procedures
         createAccount and loginProcedure helps the overall algorithm perform and regulate the core functions of the login screen of creating accounts
         and logging in.</p>

                <p>C.) The response explains how the loginProcedure procedure functions (“login in the user and load up the user’s diary entries if the
             correct password is entered. Otherwise, an error message will appear and the user will have to try again.”)</p>
        </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>The statement “One of the integrated algorithms…” is a great way to call attention to the requirements for this part of the scoring criteria.
     When it comes to the logical/mathematical concepts, this response leaves a lot to the imagination and only states “ load up the user’s diary
     entries if the correct password is entered”.  By explicitly stating “My program uses logic to determine…”, one can take the guesswork out of
     awarding points for the grader.

     This example does a nice job of explaining how both procedures do their work independently, but then also connects what they do in the
     conclusion.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
        <p>2c. As my program uses Firebase databases to store user data, AccountDB.GotValue is an important algorithm as it handles all data retrieved
         from the account database such as users and passwords. Because Firebase data requests are handled asynchronously to the program, it is
         necessary that when data is sent back from Firebase, the algorithm examines the tag and values sent back in order to properly redirect the

         for the user’s data in Firebase given that they had provided a valid password and an unique username. The integration of the two procedures
         createAccount and loginProcedure helps the overall algorithm perform and regulate the core functions of the login screen of creating accounts
         and logging in.</p>

<p>Focus on the process for this row of the scoring criteria.  The response to section 2b needs to cover both row 2 and row 3 on the scoring
     criteria. This response tries to cover row 3, but neglects to cover row 2. By keeping a journal of the process, a step-by-step description of
     the development of the app should be easy to put together for this requirement.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
        <p>2b. There were many problems that arose while coding the program. One of the early problems encountered was deciding how I should set up my
         study guide. For example, I could have chosen to do flashcards along with doing multiple choice. However, I felt that the flash cards would be
         more effective and efficient way of creating this app. Furthermore, when making this study guide app, I felt that there needed to be something
         else that could have made the study guide more useful for the reader. Originally, there were just flashcards, but I felt there was something
         else that could be done. So I included another button that allowed the user to type in the definition as the word was being given. This was a
         major development addition as it is more effective for the user to write the information than by just looking at cards. This is also more
         effective for memorization.</p>

<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>The lack of clarity in the response led this scorer to not award the point for this row.  “One of the early problems I encountered…” is the only
     part that stuck in the graders mind.  After describing that problem and its resolution, the student should have added the phrase, “Then I came
     across an opportunity to…”  This would have redirected the scorer’s attention to check off the requirements from the scoring criteria.</p>

<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>To be sure to earn the point for row 5, students must clearly touch on all three of the “and” requirements.  The first is to assure that the
     algorithm uses mathematical or logical concepts.  The if/else block is used in this example meets that requirement.  The second part should follow
     with the step-by-step process of the algorithm.  This example doesn’t do a good job of that, but does enough to get the point across.  The last
     requirement is met as it relates the algorithm to the overall program in the introductory sentence.  This explicit type of technical writing leaves
     nothing up to interpretation.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
        <p>2c. This particular algorithm is essential to the program because it allows the user to go to the next flashcard. When the next button is
         clicked, it displays the label font text and then doesn't show the back text. The index also determined which flashcard that you are on, in
         which you keep going to the next term as the next button is clicked. Furthermore, if the index is bigger than the number of items in the list
         then it restarts back to 1, or the first item in the list. This is the same for the other algorithm as they both use an index. One of the
         independent algorithms makes so that user can type in the term as the other algorithm is displaying the definition as a flashcard. Together as
         a combination, this makes it so that the user has a study guide environment in which they can type in the necessary term to the definition and
         then be able to go to the next set of terms.</p>

                <p>AND</p>
                <p>C.) The response briefly states that one algorithm "makes [it] so that user can type in the term as the other algorithm is displaying the
             definition as a flashcard." However, it is not clear where each of these algorithms is in the supplied code segment, so it is not clear if
             these algorithms are included in the identified algorithm.</p>
                <p><i>While the reader may be able to identify sub-algorithms in the main algorithm, the student’s response must clearly identify the sub-

<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>Again, covering all three requirements is necessary to earn this point in the scoring criteria- 2 out of 3 did not get the job done on this
     example.  The two integrated algorithms from the overall algorithm are both if/else statements so that covers the first two requirements.  While
     the sentence starter “One of the independent algorithms…” is a great attention-getter for the reader, this example follows it up with an algorithm
     that is not part of the selected one.  Be sure students double-check their continuity to clean up this type of mistake.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>

When the next button is clicked, it displays the label font text and then doesn't show the back text.

<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
<p>While this explanation does a good job of telling what the procedure does, it waits until the last sentence to earn the point.  Giving the reader
     the reasons  “...makes the general coding clearer and easier to read…” effectively illustrates the managing of the complexity.  It also subtly
     points out how it reduces redundancy.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
        <p>2d. This particular abstraction is used to determine if the word you type in, is correct. This abstraction uses mathematical concepts by
         determining if the word you type in and the actual term, are equal. If they do happen to be equal, then this will be shown in the
         “lblWriteWrong.” Furthermore, this abstraction uses logical concepts by determining if the word the user types in is true, then it will be
         displayed as correct through the Write Wrong label. However if the word the user types in is a false word, then it will show that it is
         incorrect through the Write Wrong label. By creating this abstraction it makes the general coding clearer and easier to read as it is already
         being used once. </p>
