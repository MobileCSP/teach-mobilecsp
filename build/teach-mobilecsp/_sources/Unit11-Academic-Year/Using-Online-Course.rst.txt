Using the Online Course with Students
======================================

Course Copies
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

<p>Some participants have asked for copies of the course to be made so that they can use it with their individual students. After much discussion, we have decided not to provide these at this time. Here are our reasons:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Teachers would need to learn how to use Google Course Builder and we (the instructors and the mentors) do not have the resources to train teachers on how to do that at this time.</li>
   <li>It would be very time consuming to update multiple copies of the course as we refine the materials.</li>
   <li>In order to release content on separate schedules in each course, teachers would have to be made an administrator. So, teachers would have access to ALL the courses, not just their own.</li>
   <li>We believe there's a unique opportunity for students to interact with their peers in the US and across the world working on App Inventor if they are all using the same course.</li>
   <li>The data on student understanding of concepts (as measured by the formative interactive exercises) would be difficult for us to compile and analyze in order to improve the course.</li>
</ul>

Registering Students
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

<p>Students need a Gmail account to sign up for the course. If you were able to register using your school Gmail address, your students should be able to do so as well. If you needed to use a personal Gmail account, then they will as well. We will not be collecting any registration information from them beyond their name. We will be collecting standard web and learning analytics (disclosed in the Privacy Policy linked at the bottom of every page). This includes what lessons participants complete, what they answer for the interactive exercises (in the aggregate), how they interact with the videos (play, pause), etc.</p>

Monitoring Student Progress with the Teacher Dashboard
-----------------------

The Mobile CSP Teacher Dashboard is a feature on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Student Site (blue toolbar)&nbsp;</span>that allows teachers to monitor the progress of their students as they complete the student lessons and self-check questions at the bottom of each lesson. Some notes and reminders:<br></p><ul><li><span class="yui-non"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Access |&nbsp;</span>In order to use the Teacher Dashboard, you will need to complete the&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/8cVaEbpjUnJ3PXkL8" target="_blank" title="">Request Access to Dashboard Form</a>. The team will review requests and typically responds within 72 hours. Once approved, you will receive an email with instructions on how to use the Teacher Dashboard.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding Students |&nbsp;</span>Student emails must be the same email that they used to register at course.mobilecsp.org.</li><li><b>Reporting a problem</b>&nbsp;| If you encounter an issue while using the Teacher Dashboard, visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/teach_mobilecsp/modules/extra_tabs/render?index=0" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://course.mobilecsp.org/teach_mobilecsp/modules/extra_tabs/render?index%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1595386624986000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTUx05XS9aT7xSiaRj2-SUXfrTYA" title="">Teacher Resources page</a>&nbsp;to report a problem.

Projects
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<p>While the course is set up so that students can submit and review each others projects online, that is entirely up to individual teachers. Each class will be working at their own pace and so may have projects ready at different times of the year. However, students might find it a unique way to interact with others and see what kinds of projects have been created for this course.</p>
