====================

.. raw:: html

	<p>Review the materials posted on the student site under <a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/unit?unit=149&lesson=201" target="_blank" title="">Careers in IT and CS</a>. This is a good time to encourage students to consider careers in CS and IT! 
	   
	  
	<p>Spend a day or two doing the POGIL group activity where students choose an IT/CS career and do more research on it and present their results in a presentation or poster to the class. You can use these posters to decorate your classroom!
