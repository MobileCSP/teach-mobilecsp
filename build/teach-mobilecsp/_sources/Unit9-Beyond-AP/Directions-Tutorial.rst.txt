Learning Activities
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<h4 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 90 minutes (Option 1) or 45 minutes (Option 2)</h4>
	
	<h4>Hook/Motivation</h4>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Review (5 minutes):</b> Ask students to list the sensors used in the course. Have them identify how the sensors enable a mobile device user to interact with their environment.
	    Students should identify orientation, location, accelerometer, and energy sensors, just to name a few. The students should be able to explain how orientation, accelerometer, and location sensors facilitate new ways of interacting with the environment since they have already used these sensors in previous apps.</li>
	<li><b>Explanation (5 minutes):</b> Explain the My Directions app to the students and its use of sensors. Today students will learn about energy sensors and continue working with location sensors.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Learning Experiences</h4>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Activity (10 minutes):</b> Have students read about <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/cise/csbytes/newsletter/vol1/pdf/vol1i8.pdf" target="_blank">Smart Grid</a> technology.  If time permits, you can also have the students complete the classroom activity at the bottom.</li>
	<li><b>Walk-through (20 minutes):</b> Lead the students through the My Directions Tutorial, which explains how to use the location sensor and Google Maps to get directions to and from a location. If students finish early, have them complete the enhancements.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Reflect, Revise, and/or Recap</h4>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wrap-up (10 minutes):</b> Review what students have learned about location awareness. Students should write a reflection in their portfolio (this may be assigned as homework) and complete the interactive exercises on location awareness.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Student Objectives (Knowledge and Skills)</h3>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
	   <li>Reproduce the My Directions app on a mobile device</li>
	   <li>Deepen their understanding of location awareness</li>
	   <li>Deepen their understanding of how to use App Inventor's LocationSensor component</li>

Professional Development Reflection
----------------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

	 <p>Discuss the following questions with other teachers in your professional development program.</p>
	 <ul>    
	   <li>How does this lesson help students toward the enduring understanding that programming is facilitated by appropriate abstractions, in this case a <i>list</i>?</li>
	   <li> Is there anything else you would need to have or know to teach this lesson effectively?</li>
	   <li>What specific elements of this lesson (examples, activities, etc.) would you change?</li>
	   <li>How would you modify or add to the interactive exercises (formative assessments)?</li>
