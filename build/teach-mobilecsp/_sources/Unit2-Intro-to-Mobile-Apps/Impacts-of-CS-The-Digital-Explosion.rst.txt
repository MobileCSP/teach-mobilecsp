      <a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/unit?unit=1&amp;lesson=62" target="_blank" title="">first lesson</a> that focuses explicitly on the societal impact of computing.  Students will read the first chapter of the <em>Blown to Bits</em> book about the "digital explosion" - i.e., the idea that all of today's content (movies, books, images, sounds, etc.) is represented as bits (0s and 1s) and that the amount of such data is growing exponentially.  In this and future <i>Blown to Bits</i> lessons, students will read and discuss and reflect upon various ways that computing affects their lives.  This is one of the primary ways the global impact of computing, both positive and negative, is reinforced in the course.

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 90 minutes</h3>
    <h3>Day 1 (45 minutes)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 Minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Ask the students to look around their classroom and identify things that process digital data, or bits. This might include: computers, calculators, light switches (with sensors), smart boards, projectors, phones/tablets, etc. Keep a running list on the board for them to see. </li>
    <li>Explain to students that Chapter 1 of Blown to Bits makes the point that today everything is digital -- that is, everything is represented by binary digits or bits. And it provides some provocative examples of the societal implications of this digital explosion.  Direct students to read Chapter 1 to learn more about how digital our world has become.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (25 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Introduce the textbook to the students and give them the Double Entry Journal Template to record their thoughts. Students should read pg. 1-4 in Chapter 1 of Blown to Bits and Koan 4. Students should record at least 4 quotes or thoughts in the journal.</li>
    <li>In small groups of 3-4 students, discuss the reading. Have each student share at least one of their quotes from the reading.</li>
    <li>Ask each group to share one idea from their discussion with the whole class. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect, and Revise (10 minutes):</b> Introduce the journal assignment and hand out the tracking your technology use template.  (See directions on student side). Ask students to make predictions of how many different objects they will interact with that process digital data, or bits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Day 2 (45 minutes)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (15 Minutes):</b> Have students share the types of objects and the number of times they used them using some kind of data tracking (board, spreadsheet, etc.) - can they be organized into categories or types of some kind? How do these compare to their predictions?</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (25 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Ask students if there are both positive and negative impacts from the technology they used? Ask them if they believe that the technology itself is good or bad? <i>They will likely identify positive impacts and may have difficulty with negative impacts. The discussion after the reading should help them to better identify negative impacts of using technology.</i></li>
    <li>Students should read the second part of Chapter 1, Good and Ill, Promise and Peril (pg. 13-16). (This could also be assigned to read outside of class.)</li>
    <li>Students should get into groups of 4, then use the Debate Team Carousel handout with one of the following questions/topics. Each group can have the same or a different topic.
            <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.diigo.com/user/mobilecsp" target="_blank" title="">Select topics based on the list of current events articles at diigo.com/user/mobilecsp.</a></li>
    <li>Examples of Questions: Should voting be electronic? Should apps be used to help track and diagnose mental health? Should digital assistants (such as Alexa) talk like humans?</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect, and Revise (10 minutes):</b> Pick a current real-world example that students can explore.  (Examples might be Google Glass, Apple Watch, FitBits)  Students should describe what the product/initiative is and also discuss its positive and negative implications on life in the Digital Age.  Students will need to find a similar example for their portfolio reflection.</li>
    </ul>
    <!--
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hook/Motivation - Pre Reading Activity (5 Minutes):&lt;/b&gt; Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/datapowers.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Data Powers of Ten”&lt;/a&gt; list as a guide,
           &lt;ul&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;Ask students to guess how many bytes there are in various objects such as a novel or high-resolution photograph. (You could provide a prize to the student who guesses the closest to the correct answer without going over).&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;OR Ask students to rank a list of objects in order from least to most bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;/ul&gt;
        Explain to students that Chapter 1 of Blown to Bits makes the point that today everything is digital -- that is, everything is represented by binary digits or bits. And it provides some provocative examples of the societal implications of this digital explosion.  Direct students to read Chapter 1 to learn more about how digital our world has become.&lt;/li&gt;
    
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Homework - During Reading Activity&lt;/b&gt;: Students should complete a Double-Entry Journal as they read Chapter 1.  (A template is provided in the chapter’s materials list.)  The students’ journal should summarize and comment on at least four quotes or summarized ideas that the authors bring forward in this chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
    
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experiences and Explorations (60 minutes):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making Connections to Student Reading&lt;/b&gt;  Ask students to share an item or two from the chapter that they included in their Double-Entry Journal.  They can share an idea from the text which they thought was important and then can tell what they thought about that idea.&lt;/li&gt;
    
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deeper Examination of Text:&lt;/b&gt; Working in teams, ask students to discuss the portfolio reflection questions and have them record their answers in their Google portfolios.&lt;/li&gt;
    
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deeper Discussion of the Text:&lt;/b&gt; Ask each group to share its answers for one of the portfolio questions.  Other groups can add their ideas once groups have shared.  All students can make additions and revisions to their responses in the Google portfolios.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rethink, Reflect, and Revise (10 minutes):&lt;/b&gt; Pick a current real-world example that students can explore.  (Examples might be Google Glass, Apple Watch, FitBits)  Students should describe what the product/initiative is and also discuss its positive and negative implications on life in the Digital Age.  Students should record their findings about the example in their Google portfolio. Have students share their ideas and discuss their real-world examples with the entire class.&lt;/li&gt;

    <h4>Assessment Opportunities</h4>
    <p>You can examine students’ work on the interactive exercise and their reflection portfolio entries to assess their progress on the following learning objectives. If students are able to do what is listed there, they are ready to move on to the next lesson.
        </p><ul>
    <li><i><b>Portfolio Reflections:</b></i>
    <br/>LO 2.1.1 - Students should be able to describe how bits are used to store many different kinds of data (photos, files, video, etc.)
            <br/>LO 7.3.1 - Students should be able to describe how the digital explosion has both positive and negative impacts. Common examples include saving someone's life by using the cell phone to locate them (positive) and bullying on social media (negative).
          </li>
    <li><i><b>In the class discussion, look for:</b></i>
    <br/>- Identification of both positive and negative impacts, without an overwhelming set of positive impacts
            <br/>- Completion of the double entry journal to help guide discussion
          </li>

    <div class="yui-wk-div">
    <ul>
    <li><span class="yui-non">If students are struggling with the reading, consider making the readings in-class activities (silent reading or in groups) instead of a homework activity. After reading, students could make a slide for their assigned pages resulting in a collaborative class presentation for the chapter.

    <p>This is the first of the Blown to Bits lessons during the course. During this lesson, you want to set the expectations for the chapter readings. For example, explaining that they are advanced reading topics but the activities are designed to help them read it and learn the material means that they should focus on those activities.</p>
