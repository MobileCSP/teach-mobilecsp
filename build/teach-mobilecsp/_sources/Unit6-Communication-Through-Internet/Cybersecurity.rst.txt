Learning Activities

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes): </b>Recall that in Unit 5, we saw that it is very difficult to guess a long complex password. Open <a href="http://howsecureismypassword.net" target="_blank" title="">howsecureismypassword.net</a> in a browser. Try entering the following potential passwords and record the results. Then discuss the students’ findings as a class as well as ask: What would you do if your password is stolen? How might certain apps/websites try to prevent other people from logging into your account using your password?</span><ul><li>abc123</li><li>ComputerScience123</li><li>ComputerSciencer0ck$</li></ul></li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (35 minutes):</b>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Part 1: Authentication</b> - Using Video 1 (1:59), discuss two-factor and multi-factor authentication. Describe in general how multi-factor authentication works and the types of evidence used (e.g. Something you know, something you have, something you are). Using Video 2 (2:24), further explain biometric authentication. After watching the video, take 2-3 minutes to ask students to share what types of biometric authentication they have seen in real life or in movies.</li>
    <li><b>Part 2: Malware</b> - Explain that although multi-factor authentication and complex passwords can be used to try to prevent unauthorized account access, another computer security issue to be aware of is malware. Using Video 3 (2:26) discuss malware and the steps you can take to prevent malware and computer viruses.<br/></li>
    <li><b>Part 3: Unauthorized Access</b> - Using Video 4 (2:31), discuss how phishing, keylogging, and rogue access points can be used to gain unauthorized access to an individual’s personal information. Explain the importance of firewalls</li>
    <li><b>Activity:</b> Select one or more of the following activities for students complete after watching and discussing the videos. Students should document their findings in their portfolio reflection before the end of class.<ol><li><span class="yui-non">Can you spot when you’re being phished? Do the Phishing Quiz working in pairs or POGIL groups: <a href="https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com" target="_blank" title="">https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com</a>. See how many you get right.</span></li><li><span class="yui-non">In pairs or POGIL groups, investigate this map <a href="http://cybermap.kaspersky.com/" target="_blank" title="">http://cybermap.kaspersky.com/</a> (click on a country and more details or statistics) and <a href="http://securelist.com/statistics/" target="_blank" title="">http://securelist.com/statistics/</a>  which shows the current week’s infections and attacks. What are the top 3 attacked countries? What country has the highest rate of infections? What is the top infection (virus) currently?</span></li><li>Investigate a famous or recent malware, hacking, or security breach incident. Write down who, what, when, where, how, and the consequences of the incident.</li></ol>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>(Optional) Activity (30 minutes):</b> Divide students into groups of 2-4. First, they should discuss and write down their responses to the questions designated before the video. Then, show the video. After watching the PBS video, they should discuss and write down their responses to the questions designated after the video. Facilitate groups sharing their answers to both sets of questions.</li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (5 minutes):</b> In the time that remains, have students complete the self-check questions and their portfolio reflections.</li>
