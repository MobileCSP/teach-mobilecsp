    <p class="overview"><a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/unit?unit=23&amp;lesson=55" target="_blank" title="">This lesson</a> extends the app started in the 'LightsOff Tutorial'.  Students work in pairs to complete several small challenges to enhance the app, such as customizing the appearance of the app and changing the speed of the animation as the game progresses. It reinforces the enduring understandings that programming can be used for creative expression and that collaborating (working in pairs) is an effective way to solve problems.</p>

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <h3 id="est-length">Estimated Length: 45 minutes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Hook/Motivation (5 minutes):</b> Using Think-Pair-Share, have the students review and explain how the LightsOff app was created. Discuss some ideas for enhancements, including keeping score. Have the students write out the rules for how the score gets changed in the game. Reinforce the concept of an algorithm for keeping score.</li>
    <li><b>Experiences and Explorations (25 minutes):</b> Students work in pairs on enhancements to the app; teacher answers questions. If any of the students finish early, have them begin working on their reflections.
        <br/>It's important that students be encouraged to be creative not only in coming up with good ideas for their apps but also in trying to solve their problems that arise during the programming task.  Students should be encouraged to discuss their work and ideas with their partner, with other students, and with the teacher, especially for the advanced mini projects. When a program doesn't work as expected, promote the idea that the student must take on the role of a detective and investigate what is causing the problem. This is what is meant by "debugging".  It's also important for students to test their work thoroughly — it's often not enough to run the app once and conclude that it is correct
    <br/>If you want to evaluate each mini-project separately, remind students to save each mini project using the SAVE AS Command as specified in the Mini Projects. </li>
    <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (15 minutes):</b> Students make a new entry in their portfolios. Have the students describe the modifications and enhancements that they made to the app. Also ask the students to reflect on their programming experience.See the mini projects solutions. Discuss what issues the students encountered while modifying the app. Check students understanding using the interactive exercises.</li>
